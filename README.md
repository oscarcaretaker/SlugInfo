## Questions ðŸ˜Š
### How am I fetching the data about slugs?
- With a little help from our friends *BeautifulSoup* and *requests*, I scrape data straight from the source at [SlugTerra Wiki](https://slugterra.fandom.com/wiki/SlugTerra_Wiki)â€”no secret potions involved!
- I also employ `quote()` from `urllib` to magically generate URLs dynamically, making it feel like the slugs are just waiting for me to call them out!

### Whatâ€™s powering the backend?
- Our backend superstar is Django, which neatly stores and displays the data, like a proud parent showing off its slug collection!
- URL mapping is carefully implemented to keep routes clear and straightforwardâ€”think of it as GPS for our slugs.
- Functional views handle all the hard work, efficiently processing userâ€™s request. So when you want slug info, Djangoâ€™s got your back.

### What did I use on the frontend?
- Thanks to Bootstrap 5, we have a fully responsive design that looks great across all devices, with some custom CSS flair to keep things unique!
- The UI is simple yet elegant, making each slug feel like the star it deserves to be on the screen.
